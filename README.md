# Deepkit Community Nx Plugins

NX plugins for rapidly scaffolding new Deepkit applications

## Status

This project is currently in an alpha state and the generators are subject to change as development continues.
You should be able to safely use it to scaffold Deepkit applications but as improvements are made to the generators there won't be an effort to provide an upgrade path for older versions of the plugins.

## Generators

This package provides multiple generators for scaffolding or modifying Deepkit applications. [Check the readme](./packages/nx-deepkit/README.md) for instructions and information on how to interact with the generators
